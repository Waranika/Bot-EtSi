Context
-------

The Etsi Community server is a vibrant platform where engineers from varied disciplines come together to share, brainstorm, and build upon new ideas. The need for a tool to streamline this process of collaboration and to ensure effective communication among members led to the creation of the Etsi Community Discord Bot.

Objective
---------

The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing the Etsi Community server, making it easier for members to collaborate, share knowledge, and work on projects together. The bot aims to automate routine tasks, enforce server rules, and enhance the overall user experience within the community.

Features
--------

*   **Terms and Conditions**: Automatically sends the server's terms and conditions to newcomers, ensuring they understand the community rules before participating.
*   **Role Attribution**: Assigns roles to members based on their expertise and the projects they are working on. This helps in identifying who does what and fosters a structured project environment.
*   **Project Salons Creation**: Dynamically creates channels (salons) accessible only to members with specific roles, ensuring focused and relevant discussions.
*   **Meeting Announcements**: Broadcasts scheduled meetings to the entire server, ensuring everyone is informed and can participate if interested.

Benefits
--------

*   **Streamlined Onboarding**: New members receive immediate guidance and understanding of community expectations.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration**: Role-specific channels promote targeted discussions, making collaboration more efficient.
